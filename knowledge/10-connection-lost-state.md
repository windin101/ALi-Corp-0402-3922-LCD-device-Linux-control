# Connection Lost State Behavior

## Observed Behavior

During testing with the `minimal_connection.py` script, we observed an interesting behavior:

1. The device successfully completes all state transitions:
   - Animation state (0-55 seconds)
   - Connecting state (55-58 seconds)
   - Connected state (at 58 seconds)

2. When the device reaches the Connected state:
   - It responds to basic TEST UNIT READY commands (albeit with status 1, indicating "not ready")
   - It shows "Waiting for connection" on the screen

3. When we attempt to send more complex commands that require data transfer (INQUIRY, REQUEST SENSE, or F5 commands):
   - The commands time out after multiple retries
   - The device screen displays "Connection lost will close in 10 seconds"
   - Despite the message, the device continues to stay on this screen indefinitely
   - It continues to respond to basic TEST UNIT READY commands even in this state

## Analysis

This behavior suggests:

1. **Partial USB Communication**: The device can maintain basic USB protocol communication even in the "Connection lost" state. This explains why it continues to respond to TEST UNIT READY commands.

2. **Data Transfer Issues**: The device appears to have issues specifically with data transfer phases of USB Mass Storage protocol commands. This could be due to:
   - Internal buffer or timing issues in the device firmware
   - Protocol implementation differences between our code and the original software
   - USB driver or hardware timing issues

3. **Recovery Limitations**: Once in the "Connection lost" state, the device does not seem to have a self-recovery mechanism. It neither fully disconnects nor returns to normal operation.

## Possible Solutions

Based on these observations, we can consider several approaches:

1. **Exact Timing Replication**: The new `exact_sequence.py` script attempts to replicate the exact timing and command sequence from successful captures, without trying to be adaptive.

2. **Modified Command Structure**: We may need to adjust how we structure the data phase of commands, possibly with different buffer sizes or timing.

3. **Simpler Command Set**: Instead of using F5 commands for initialization, we might try a more minimal approach that uses only the simplest commands.

4. **Hardware Reset**: If available, a hardware reset mechanism might be needed to recover the device from the "Connection lost" state.

## Next Steps

1. Test the `exact_sequence.py` script to see if precisely matching the timing and command sequence of successful captures resolves the issue.

2. Analyze the successful command captures in even more detail, looking for subtle differences in command structure, timing, or flow control.

3. Consider implementing a lower-level USB communication approach that gives more control over the exact USB protocol details.
