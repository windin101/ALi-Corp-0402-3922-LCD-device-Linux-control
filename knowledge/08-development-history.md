# Development History and Challenges

## Project Timeline

### August 18, 2025: Initial Discovery

- Developed robust USB communication class with error handling

## Major Challenges

### 1. Tag Synchronization Issues

**Problem**: The device frequently returned CSW tags that didn't match the CBW tags sent by the host, causing communication failures.

**Investigation**: Detailed analysis revealed that tag mismatch frequency varied significantly based on the device's lifecycle state:
- Animation state: >75% mismatch rate
- Connecting state: 25-50% mismatch rate
- Connected state: <5% mismatch rate

**Solution**: Implemented lifecycle-aware tag validation that adapted to the current state:
- Animation state: Accept any tag
- Connecting state: Allow for reasonable tag mismatches
- Connected state: Enforce strict tag matching

### 2. Device Lifecycle Management

**Problem**: The device exhibited different behavior patterns at different times, making consistent communication difficult.

**Investigation**: Prolonged testing revealed a distinct four-state lifecycle with specific visual cues and communication patterns.

**Solution**: Implemented explicit lifecycle state tracking based on:
- Elapsed time since connection
- Command count and success rate
- Visual indicators on the display
- Tag mismatch patterns

### 3. USB Pipe Errors

**Problem**: Commands frequently failed with "pipe error" (error code 32), especially during the Animation state.

**Investigation**: Determined that pipe errors occurred when:
- Commands were sent too rapidly
- Certain commands were sent in the wrong state
- The device was busy with internal processing

**Solution**: Implemented robust error handling:
- Clear halts on affected endpoints
- Add adaptive delays based on current state
- Reset device when necessary
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### 4. Reconnection Events

**Problem**: The device would disconnect and reconnect during normal operation, losing all state.

**Investigation**: Found that reconnections occurred:
- During the initial Animation state
- After certain error conditions
- When invalid commands were sent

**Solution**: Implemented reconnection detection and handling:
- Reset tag counter after reconnection
- Restart initialization sequence
- Preserve high-level state across reconnections
- Track USB device removal and insertion events

### 5. Image Display Format

**Problem**: Initial attempts to display images resulted in corrupted output or no display at all.

**Investigation**: Packet analysis revealed:
- RGB565 color format requirement
- Specific header format with big-endian coordinates
- Special command sequence required before display

**Solution**: Implemented proper image conversion and display logic:
- RGB888 to RGB565 conversion with correct byte order
- Proper image header construction
- Initialization and animation control sequence before display

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Lifecycle-Aware Communication

The most critical discovery was that the device operates in distinct lifecycle states with different communication requirements. Reliable communication requires adapting to the current state rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

### 2. Tag Management Strategies

Tag synchronization issues are not random but tied to the device's internal state. Different tag validation strategies are needed for different states, from lenient validation in the Animation state to strict validation in the Connected state.

### 3. Robust Error Handling

USB communication with the device requires comprehensive error handling, including:
- Endpoint halt clearing
- Device reset capabilities
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- State-specific error recovery strategies

### 4. Initialization Sequence

The device requires a specific initialization sequence with precise timing:
- ~56-58 seconds of continuous TEST UNIT READY commands
- Proper command sequence for display initialization
- Animation control before image display

### 5. Documentation Importance

Thorough documentation of the protocol, command set, and device behavior was essential due to:
- Non-standard protocol implementation
- Lack of official documentation
- Complex state machine behavior
- Inconsistent tag handling

## Outstanding Questions

Despite our extensive analysis, some aspects of the device behavior remain not fully understood:

1. **Internal State Machine**: The exact triggers for state transitions within the device.

2. **Animation Mechanism**: How the built-in animations are stored and controlled.

3. **Tag Reset Triggers**: The precise conditions that cause the device to reset its internal tag counter.

4. **Mode Settings**: The full range of display modes and their effects (beyond mode 5).

5. **Power Management**: The device's power management capabilities and sleep states.

## Future Directions

Based on our findings, future work could focus on:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Faster image updates and partial screen updates.

2. **Advanced Features**: Investigation of additional display capabilities not yet discovered.

3. **Multi-Device Support**: Handling multiple ALi LCD devices connected simultaneously.

4. **Simplified API**: Creating a higher-level API that abstracts the complexity of the device.

5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
