## Addressing Outstanding Questions

Throughout this roadmap, we will focus on answering the outstanding questions identified in the knowledge base:

1. **Internal State Machine**: Through extensive testing, we will map the exact triggers for state transitions.

2. **Animation Mechanism**: Phase 3 will investigate how built-in animations are stored and controlled.

3. **Tag Reset Triggers**: Phase 2 testing will identify the precise conditions that cause tag resets.

4. **Mode Settings**: Phase 3 will explore the full range of display modes beyond mode 5.

5. **Power Management**: Long-term testing will investigate power management capabilities and sleep states.
